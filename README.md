## Additional Instructions

When the program is executed, a prompt
```
Enter file name:
```
will ask for the file name. The input file name should be without the file extension `.txt` as the program automatically appends the extension.

Thus, the file `sample.txt` should be input as

```
Enter file name: sample
```
